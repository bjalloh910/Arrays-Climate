This is my reflection for assignment 1: Assignment 1 was really difficult for me. I was having issues with making my files cooperate together during the first few days so that took a great chunk of my time. When I finally found a solution to make my files work together the first few methods and test cases were very straight forward and simple to do. Reading in the data. The putting it together was the most difficult for me. I tried but I just couldn't understand how to make it work in the end. Next time I won't waste too much time focusing on things that aren't really important and try to start coding much earlier and maybe have some type of blueprint of how I want to approach things. I enjoyed the first half of the methods. I just wish the assignment wasn't so long.
